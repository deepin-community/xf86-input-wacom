xf86-input-wacom (0.34.99.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make sibling device name matching slightly more lenient.
    This improves support of subdevices for MobileStudio Pro and Cintiq Pro.

  * Revert to Update properties with a timer func.
    With the new input thread it was possible to send events from that thread
    directly, but doing that had some other undesirable consequences, like
    triggering a bug in the server which could make it crash.  Later versions
    of the server caught that, and instead caused this to spew warnings to the
    xorg logs.   Closes: #856140, #862639

  * xsetwacom: use XkbGetMap instead of XkbGetKeyboard.
    This is more robust in cases where certain keyboard description components
    are missing.

  * Introduce "Pressure2K" config option for incompatible software.
    The 0.34.0 release included commit 3e56ce44 which increased the range of
    pressure values that are reported to better support newer devices which
    have greater precision than the historical range allowed for.

    Unfortunately, there appear to be some buggy applications which don't take
    into account the advertised range (though GTK 2/3 and Qt 3-5 should), and
    may misbehave with the new range.  Until they too are fixed, this release
    includes a workaround that users can enable, forcing the use of the old
    pressure range.

    To enable that, you'll want to add something like the following snippet to
    a file in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d directory (see xorg.conf(5) and wacom(4)
    for more details of doing that).

     Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Wacom pressure compatibility"
        MatchDriver "wacom"
        Option "Pressure2K" "true"
     EndSection

    Closes: #862671

  * Prevent xf86-input-wacom from binding to pure-keyboard devices.
    Along with other updates to the xorg conf, possibly Closes: #804743

    conf priority to 70.  Along with a similar change to the priority that
    libinput registers itself with, this Closes: #825391
  * Move xorg-wacom.pc to a multiarch dir so that it can be used when cross
    compiling too.  Many thanks to Helmut Grohne for the work he's done on
    making that possible for more distro packages and for doing the legwork
    to catch this and figure out what was needed here.  Closes: #837949
  * Includes some fixes for touch handling, possibly Closes: #803390, #793159

  * I dedicate this snapshot to Odin^Wclang.
  * Include the systemd unit file for ISDv4 serial devices.
  * Drop the old udev rules with all the by-type symlinks, now that XOrg
    hotplug actually works we shouldn't need those anymore.  Just use the
    simpler rules from upstream (after prefixing them with a priority).

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.5+20100416-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Normalise pressure sensitivity.  This helps avoid a heavily used stylus
    from inadvertantly generating a click when brought into proximity due
    to its initial unloaded pressure value creeping up.
  * Use pkg-config to decide where to install 20-wacom.conf.  Closes: #578113
    Proper detection of this in the upstream install means we don't need to
    manually remove the .fdi anymore either.

  * Move 10-wacom.conf to 20-wacom.conf, as merged upstream.
  * Add xutils-dev to B-D, for xorg-macros.pc
    It doesn't seem to actually cause any problems to have that missing,
    but it does bark in the build logs and we may be using things from it
    in the not too distant future now.

  * Add the udev rules back, tweaked for post-hal hotplugging support with X.
  * Add build-deps for x11proto-kb-dev, libxkbfile-dev.  The new upstream now
    #includes xorg/xkbstr.h from xserver-xorg-dev, which in current Sid then
    in turn #includes X11/extensions/XKB.h and X11/extensions/XKBproto.h from
    x11proto-kb-dev and X11/extensions/XKMformat.h from libxkbfile-dev.

xf86-input-wacom (0.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Great Leap Forward.
  * Restructure the package to only contain the Xorg driver.
    The kernel driver has been regularly merged with mainline for quite some
    time already, and the Xorg driver is moving closer to upstream now too,
    so we can drop any pretense of this still being an agglomeration of things
    or of needing to be one, and simply tack the packaging needed for X onto a
    real git repo.  Anything else can go in its own package and/or repo.

    Closes: #464448
  * Split lintian-overrides into two files because lintian barfs if the

    bump compat to 6 if we are going to be forced to depend on it anyhow.

  * Add Provides: xserver-xorg-input-2 so the next X ABI transition will be
    a bit less painful for people.
  * Update the udev rules for new tablets.  Lower-case the product ids since
    udev appears to be case sensitive doing string compares for hex values.
    Nice one guys.
  * Add a build-dep for pkg-config, it appears to have infected XOrg now too.

  * Update vi.po, thanks to Clytie Siddall. Closes: #427020
  * Drop the external module package, upstream seems to be syncing fairly
    regularly with the mainstream kernel team again, so this should not
    be needed by most people, and causes confusion and trouble for the rest.
    Closes: #418008, #417140, #404471, #317287
  * Lintian now bitches about reusing DH_COMPAT for the source package, so

wacom-tools (0.7.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New linuxwacom release.  Better support for PenPartner, DTF-521
    and xorg7.  Kernel 2.6 < 2.6.8 no longer supported.
  * Remove patches incorporated upstream.
  * Specify xorg-sdk and xlib locations explicitly still to avoid
    linuxwacom trying to install to lib64 if a 64bit kernel is found.
    It can be worked around for 64 bit builds, but totally breaks
    building in a ia32 chroot on such a machine if we don't do this.

  * Update the wacom-kernel-modules package for the change in kernel

    not solve the original issue of upgrading a kernel without a change
    in the kernel version.

    Bark at the user to remove them if they have been changed locally.
    Being conffiles, they are not removed on upgrade, even if they
    are no longer provided by the package.  But newer udev barfs on

    supplied as part of the xorg source package.
  * Fix udev rules, again, it may still be a moving target,
    but let's hope its getting a little tired of ducking
    and weaving too.  We now provide a convenience link to
    /dev/input/wacom for users of a single tablet, and named
    links for the convenience of users with multiple tablets
    of different types.  Users with multiple tablets of the
    same type will need to bind them to the /dev/input/by-path
    nodes that correspond to each tablet.
    Closes: #324391, #358057
  * Re-implemented device rebinding from userspace, using a
    udev RUN rule and a small script to check and rebind
    if required.

wacom-tools (0.6.6-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added cs.po, thanks to Miroslav Kure.  Closes: #314986
  * Added jp.po, thanks to TANAKA Atushi.  Closes: #322411
  * Fixed typo in debconf template (closes: #324086), and
    added vi.po, thanks to Clytie Siddall. Closes: #324087
  * Only set KSRC to a simple default if it is not already
    set.  (cf. #315130 and #341823)
  * Rip out obsolete FLAVOUR support in line with similar
    changes to kernel-package.
  * Remove unused dh_* boilerplate.

wacom-tools (0.6.6-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The promised new upstream is still in limbo, so in the
    meantime, s/kdist_config/kdist_configure/
    Closes: #296168, #314739
  * Look for the docs in the correct source location when
    installing them to the binary package.  Closes: #300579
  * And don't pretend they are html.  That is just far too
    surprising for popular taste.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 19 Jun 2005 00:37:25 +0930

wacom-tools (0.6.6-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore build-dep on libx11-dev, despite reports to the
    contrary libxt-dev alone is evidently not sufficient.
    Closes: #294960

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Feb 2005 10:52:07 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Punt device snatching out to userspace via sysfs, it's the only
    way to be sure at present.  This is an(other) experimental
    implementation before the core kernel api is decided and only
    available for kernel 2.6.10 and later at this stage.
  * Add a udev rule to create /dev/input/wacom* for each
    wacom tablet device plugged in to the system.  Its a conffile
    so you can hard code your own device id's there if you want
    constant names that don't depend on the number of wacom devices
    you have and the order you plug them in.
  * Add a hotplug script to poke the module device snatching code.
  * Typo fix in 2.6.7/wacom.c Closes: #294642 thanks.
  * Patch missing functions into 2.6.8/wacom.c, I have a report
    that this works for people who really need it.  Closes: #287941
  * Add debhelper build-dep to the module package.  Closes: #290721
  * Add libx11 build-dep too until this is fixed properly upstream,
    and a dep on build-essential Closes: #288238 thanks.
  * Does not close #286111, nor can I reproduce it still.

wacom-tools (0.6.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * First crack at the device snatching patch.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Jan 2005 18:00:40 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed evdev patch since what it attempts to do is
    already handled in the kernel for cases where it might
    reliably work.

    Removed usbhid patch since we can get in before it
    without needing to manually maintain a list of 'quirks'.

    Removed mousedev and usbmouse patches, since the former
    is now built into 2.6 kernels anyway and cannot easily
    be replaced on the fly, and since this is simply the wrong
    approach to fixing the problem of dynamic device naming
    for generic devices IMO, it just hides it for some people
    until they buy another device.

    This and tested support for kernel 2.6, Closes: #281230
    and more...

  * Explicitly point configure at the kernel source.  Closes: #285206

  * Update the other libtool goop as well to fix FTBFS
    on mips and mipsel.  Closes: #285213

  * (ab)use a shared 'confdir' (and worse) to restore something like
    the functionality needed by wacom.modutils for wacom.modprobe
    until we can fix the kernel.  Don't try this at home kids, it is
    surely not best practice in any of the domains it kludges through.
    Though its as legal as falling asleep sober at the wheel ...

wacom-tools (0.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release incorporating submitted fixes,
    thanks Ping!
  * Add missing build depends, Closes: #281451
    thanks Andreas Jochens.
  * Included fr.po debconf template translation, Closes: #282768
    thanks Jean-Luc Coulon (f5ibh) and the debian-l10n-french ml.
  * Use DESTDIR instead of (ab)using prefix as it is supported here.
    Closes: #283037

wacom-tools (0.6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package builds arch any utils too, add suitable build depends.
    Closes: #281126  Thanks lamont.

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Nov 2004 20:54:13 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New linuxwacom beta release.
  * Improves support for Intuos3 and more recent 2.6 branch kernels.
    (but still only tested with 2.4.27, see below)

 -- Ron Lee <ron@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Nov 2004 01:32:34 +1030

wacom-tools (0.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial trivial packaging.  Note this has only been tested with 2.4.27.
  * Provides the basics from the linuxwacom project -- test and config tools,
    and kernel modules in a convenient form for users of kernel packages.
    It does not provide an updated X11 module, hopefully any important parts
    of that will be ultimately be included by the X maintainers once I look
    at what they might accept.
  * Updated config.{guess,sub}.
  * Modify the version detection to handle a non-numeric suffix
    from --append_to_version or flavour.
  * Closes: #279555
